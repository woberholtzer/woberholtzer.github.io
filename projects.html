        <img src="images/fam.jpeg" alt="haha" class="img-about">
        <p class="text-main">
           My name is Will Oberholtzer, and I was born in 2002 in New Jersey.
           Throughout my entire childhood, I was raised in Haddonfield, New Jersey
           alongside my two brothers, Max and Sam. My oldest brother, Max, is a 
           recent Ursinus graduate (class of 2018) who was also a computer science
           major!
        </p>
        <p class="text-main paragraph">
            While growing up, I played many different sports, from baseball,
            basketball, and others. However, none of those sports stuck
            out to me as much as tennis. Coming from a family of tennis
            players, I fell in love with the game from a very young age.
            After watching my older brothers compete in weekend 
            tournaments and contributing to a very successful high school
            team, I was eager to follow in their path and develop my skills.
            By the time I arrived to Haddonfield Memorial High School, I assumed
            the first singles role as a freshman, and I would proceed to maintain
            that spot for the rest of my time. After a successful high school career,
            I sought to continue my tennis career, and I once again followed my
            family ties by committing to Ursinus College, where Max would have
            a remarkable career for the Bears. Now, I am a member of the team!
        </p>
        <p class="text-main paragraph">As one who has grown with the rise of 
            technology, I have grown to take an interest in this untapped field.
            After seeing my brother Max <img src="images/tyson.jpeg" alt="haha" class="img-about">
            enjoy programming at Ursinus, I explored
            my options in high school, and I found that my high school provided
            an AP course. I proceeded to take the course, and I thoroughly enjoyed
            the problem-solving and critical thinking required to succeed as a
            programmer. This is where I started to learn Java, and I continued
            towards proffiency in the language in my early computer science courses
            at Ursinus. At college, I have been expanding my knowledge of programming
            languagues, as I have been working with Python and C++ while here. 
            Also, I've done work with low-level programming in the form of
            assembly, specifically MIPS assembly language.
        </p>
        <p class="text-main paragraph">My interest in languagues is not limited to
            programming. I have been studying Spanish in school since elementary
            school, and it has always been a subject of great interest to me.
            I graduated from high school as a member of the Spanish National Honor
            Society, and decided to continue to pursue the language in college. Unsure
            whether or not I wanted to minor or major, I eventually (and recently) decided 
            to declare a second major in Spanish.
